# Read Me File

This repository contains several files and folders integral to our research on data visualization tools. Below is a description of each component and its purpose in our study.

## Files and Folders:

1. **analysis.pynb**
   - This Python script is the cornerstone of our data analysis process. It includes comprehensive procedures for data cleaning and conducting various statistical tests. The script ensures the data extracted from the survey is accurate, reliable, and ready for in-depth analysis.

2. **survey.pdf**
   - This PDF file contains the complete survey used in our study. It includes not only the questions but also the logic and structure behind them, offering insights into how the survey was designed to meet our research objectives.

3. **Folder: data**
   - This folder is crucial as it houses the raw data collected from our survey.
     - **data.csv**: This file contains the raw results of the survey, representing the initial responses from all participants.
     - **answer_sweet.xlsx**: A detailed compilation of the answers provided in the survey, this Excel file offers a more user-friendly view of the participants' responses.

4. **Folder: transformed**
   - Post-data cleaning and processing, the results are stored in this folder.
     - **all_respondents.csv**: This file contains the cleaned and processed survey data. It represents the final dataset, post-elimination of any inconsistencies or inaccuracies found in the original data, and is ready for analysis.

## Usage

- The `analysis-survey.py` script should be run to perform data cleaning and statistical analysis. It requires the raw data files from the `data` folder.
- The `survey.pdf` provides a contextual background and understanding of the survey methodology and can be used for reference.
- Data in the `transformed` folder represents the cleaned data, which is the output of the `analysis-survey.py` script and is the dataset to be used for any further analysis or research dissemination.

Thank you for your interest in our research. Please ensure to follow the outlined structure for optimal understanding and utilization of the data and scripts provided.
